# üé• MediaDecryptionSuite

This Python script provides a comprehensive solution for handling video files, specifically focusing on downloading, decrypting, and merging video and audio streams from MPD (MPEG-DASH) URLs. It automates the entire process from fetching media through decryption to final file merging.

## üìú What is My Script?

The MediaDecryptionSuite is ideal for users needing to manage encrypted video content, allowing them to easily decrypt and merge video and audio files into a single MKV file. It's particularly useful for educators, content creators, and developers working with digital media processing and distribution.

## üöÄ Use of the Script

Before you run the script, ensure you have the necessary tools installed:
- Python 3.x
- `N_m3u8DL-RE` CLI tool
- `mp4decrypt` from Bento4 tools
- `mkvmerge` from MKVToolNix
- `aria2c` for faster downloads

---

## üîë Requirements

You will need:
- The MPD URL of the video file you want to process.
- A decryption key in the format KID:KEY.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuring the Script

Before running the script, you'll need to adjust the paths to the external tools used by the script according to their installation locations on your system. Here‚Äôs what you need to do:

1. **N_m3u8DL-RE Path**: Ensure that the `N_m3u8DL-RE` executable is in your system's PATH or modify the script to include the full path to the executable.
2. **mp4decrypt and mkvmerge**: Check that `mp4decrypt` and `mkvmerge` from Bento4 tools and MKVToolNix respectively, are accessible from your system's PATH. If not, provide the full path in the script where these commands are called.
3. **aria2c Path**: If you are using `aria2c` for faster downloads, ensure that its path is correctly set in the script or included in your system's PATH.
4. **Base Directory**: The `BASE_DIR` constant in the script is set to `"D:\drm trying"`. You should change this to a preferred directory on your system where you want the script to download and save files.
